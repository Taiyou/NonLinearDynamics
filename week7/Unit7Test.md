# Q2. Which of the pictures below shows the shape of the blue ball of initial conditions evolved forward in time under the influence of the damped pendulum dynamics?
##

# Q3. If the positive \lambda is much bigger than the negative \lambda, which of the pictures below accurately reflects where the blue ball of initial conditions will go under the influence of the dynamics?

# Q4. The action of a dissipative dynamical system contracts the state space everywhere. 
# In this question, and the ones that follow, please use the specific restricted definition of dissipation that was given in the course videos.
## Answer:  False

# Q5. The action of a nondissipative dynamical system preserves the state space volume everywhere.
## Answer: True

# Q6. Each stable and unstable manifold in a dynamical system has (Experts: at least) one associated Lyapunov exponent.
## Answer: 

# Q7. Each unstable manifold in a dynamical system has (Experts: at least) one associated Lyapunov exponent whose value is negative.
## Answer: False

# Q8. In a dissipative system, the sum of the Lyapunov exponents must be negative.
## Answer: True

# Q9. In a dissipative system, there must be at least one negative Lyapunov exponent.
## Answer: True

# Q10. In a dissipative system, there cannot be any positive Lyapunov exponents.
## Answer: False.

# Q11. A system with a chaotic attractor has at least one positive \lambda and at least one negative \lambda.
## Answer: True

# Q12. Why are projections and sections useful?
## A. Because they reduce dimension.
## B. Because they make it easier to see the period of a periodic orbit.
## C. Because they make it easier to see bifurcations.
## D. All of A-C above.
## E. None of A-C above.
## F. Only some of A-C above.
## Answer: D. All of A-C above.

# Q13. Constructing temporal sections — e.g., with a strobe light — discretizes time, converting a flow into a map.
## Answer: True.

# Q14. If we section the Lorenz attractor (seen in the figure) across the green line, what will we see?
## A straight line (if the trajectory is infinitely long).
## A copy of the Logistic bifurcation diagram.
## A Cantor set.
## A copy of the Lorenz attractor.
## Answer: A Cantor set.

# Q15. What is the capacity dimension of the unit line segment?
## 0.63
## 0
## 1
## 0.876
## Answer: 1

# Q16. What is the capacity dimension of this cantor set (which we will call C_{2/5})?
## 0.6309
## 0.8614
## 0.6826
## 0.4572
## Answer: 0.6826

# Q17. Let C_{2/5} to be the Cantor set defined in Question 16, and define C_{1/5} and C_{1/3} to be the middle-fifth- and middle-third-removed Cantor set respectively. Finally define  "<" to be the "less than" operator on how much space an object fills as approximated by capacity dimension, (e.g., a point < a line, by this definition). Which of the following string of inequalities is true?

## C_{2/5}<C_{1/3}<C_{1/5}
## C_{1/3}<C_{2/5}<C_{1/5}
## C_{1/5}<C_{1/3}<C_{2/5}
## C_{1/5}<C_{2/5}<C_{1/3}
## Answer: C_{1/3}<C_{2/5}<C_{1/5}
