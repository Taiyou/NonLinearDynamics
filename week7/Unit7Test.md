# Q2. Which of the pictures below shows the shape of the blue ball of initial conditions evolved forward in time under the influence of the damped pendulum dynamics?
##

# Q3. If the positive \lambda is much bigger than the negative \lambda, which of the pictures below accurately reflects where the blue ball of initial conditions will go under the influence of the dynamics?

# Q4. The action of a dissipative dynamical system contracts the state space everywhere. 
# In this question, and the ones that follow, please use the specific restricted definition of dissipation that was given in the course videos.
## Answer:
