# 7.1 Dynamis and state-space deformation
- Attractors
  - Attractors exist only in dissipative systems!
  - Dissipation <--> contraction of state space under the influence of the dynamics.
  - it can still have chaos if no dissipation but not just chaotic attractors.
  
 ## Q1. Smale's horseshoe is a map of the unit square into itself (experts: assume that any region of the plane can be continually deformed to the unit square).
 ## Answer: True.
 ## Q2. Smale's horseshoe maps some close points far apart (& vice-versa).
 ## Answer: True.
 ## Q4. Horseshoes:
 ### (a) Only turn up in the dynamics of the Smale horseshoe map:
 ### Answer: False. not only in the smale horsehoe map
 ### (b) are important because they play a role in proofs of chaos:
 ### Answer: True
 ### (c) turn up in the dynamics of the pendulum:
 ### Answer: True
 ## Q5. Dissipation is a necessary condition for the existence of attractors.
 ### Answer: True
 
 # 7.2 Lyapunov exponents.
 - Lyapunov exponents:
  - n-dim system has n lambda $$\lambda$$
