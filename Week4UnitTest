- E. None
- Answer: 

# Q2. What is the definition of an unstable fixed point of a dissipative dynamical system?
- A. A point in state space to which a trajectory converges.
- B. A point in state space where the dynamics are stationary (i.e., if you put it there, it'll stay there).
- C. A point in state space where the dynamics are stationary and around which any perturbation will shrink.
- D. A point in state space where the dynamics are stationary and around which any perturbation will grow.
- E. None of the above.
- Answer:

# Q3. What are possible sign configurations of the eigenvalues of an unstable fixed point in a 2D system (disregarding complex ones, which we'll get to later)?
- A. Both positive
- B. Both negative
- C. One positive, one negative
- D. Either A or C above
- E. Either B or C above
- F. Either A or B above
- Answer:

# Q4. Only dissipative dynamical systems have attractors
# Q5. What dynamical system is this state-space trajectory from? (the initial condition here is at (-22,2))
# Q6. What dynamical system is this state-space trajectory from?
# Q7. What dynamical system is this state-space trajectory from? (the initial condition is at (-22, 3.2))
# Q8. What are possible sign configurations of the eigenvalues of a saddle point in a 2D system? (Experts: disregard complex ones.)
# Q9. What is the shape of this matrix?  [1 2 3 4 5]
# Q10. How many eigenvalues does a 3x3 matrix have?  (Experts: count all complex and repeated ones individually.)
# Q11. What are the eigenvalues of: 
# Q12. Why is it a bad idea to use linear mathematics on a nonlinear system?
- You may get the wrong answer.
- Linearization is a good approximation of a nonlinear system, but only locally.
- Linearization makes the math easy, but you shouldn't use it where it's not valid.
- All of the above.
# Q13. In the picture above, x_1^* and x_2^* are fixed points.  Are there any heteroclinic orbits in that picture?
# Q14. In the picture in question 13, the stable manifold of x_1^* includes...
- A. The blue curve (to the right of x_2^*)
- B. The green curve (to the right of x_2^*)
- C. Neither A nor B. 
- D. Both A and B.
# Q15. In the picture in question 13, the unstable manifold of x_2^* includes...
- A. The blue curve (to the right of x_2^*)
- B. The green curve (to the right of x_2^*)
- C. Neither A nor B.
- D. Both A and B.
# Q16. Stable and unstable manifolds are locally tangent to the stable and unstable eigenvectors near the fixed point.
# Q17. If a dynamical system has a periodic orbit, there is no stable manifold transverse to that periodic orbit.
# Q18. Why was the title of Lorenz's 1963 paper ("Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow") provocative?
# Q19. What system do the Lorenz equations model?
# Q20. What is the dimension of the Lorenz equations?
# Q21. Changing the r parameter in the Lorenz equations does not cause bifurcations in the dynamics.
