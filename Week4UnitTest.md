# Q11. What are the eigenvalues of: 
- A. $${s}_{1} = -1, s_2 =5$
- B. $$s_1 = 1, s_2 =-5$ 
- C. $$s_1 = 2, s_2 =5$
- Answer. A. 
- 8 - (1-a)(3-a) =0

a = 5, -1

# Q12. Why is it a bad idea to use linear mathematics on a nonlinear system?
- 1. You may get the wrong answer.
- 2. Linearization is a good approximation of a nonlinear system, but only locally.
- 3. Linearization makes the math easy, but you shouldn't use it where it's not valid.
- 4. All of the above.
- Answer: 4.
